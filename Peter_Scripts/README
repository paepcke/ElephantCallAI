README
    This is the README for the 'Inference_pipeline.py' script used for processing data and running 
    the 2-stage model for elephant call prediction. 

    This script runs the inferance prediction pipeline.
    The prediction pipeline consists of 2 main components:

        1) Data processing. Given a directory with .wav files,
        generate the corresponding spectrogram representations.

        2) Generate 2-stage model predictions:

            2a) Generate 2-stage model segmentation. Predict 
            the 0/1 time segmentation given the 2-stage model.

            2b) Elephant call prediction. Output the models
            predictions for start / end times of calls 
            in csv formatt.

    The script allows for complete and partial runs of the 2 steps above:

        - Flag '--process_data': Process the '.wav' files (step 1).

        - Flag '--make_predictions': Generate elephant call predictions (step 2). 
    
    For each part of the pipeline, command line arguments are used to properly 
    specify necessary data.

KEY FILES
    This folder contains all of the python scripts needed to run the primary script
    'Inference_pipeline.py'. Additionally, the folder '2_Stage_Model/' contains
    the components of the 2-stage model. 

    When you run the script, unless otherwise specified, the default location for 
    outputed values are as follows:

        - Processed Spectrograms: By default a folder 'Spectrograms/' will be 
        created in this directory containing the processed spectrograms. Specifically,
        these processed spectrograms will exist in a sub-directory of 'Spectrograms/'
        with name based on the folder containing the original '.wav' files. To change
        this default data location use the flag '--spect_out'

        - Model 0/1 segmentations: You will not need to use this data! This is just
        used for the model to save its segmentations before post processing to 
        get the actual start/end times. This will be saved in a folder called
        'Predictions/'.

        - Model start/end elephant predictions: This folder called 'Call_Predictions/'
        will contain the csv prediction files for each of the recording days!

    Lastly, the data folder with the '.wav' files does not need to exist in this folder!

SETUP
    Below are a few basic instructions on how to create an anaconda environment and how 
    to download all of the proper dependancies to run the Inference pipeline script

    Setting up an anaconda environment:

        > conda create -n peter python=3.7.8
        > conda activate peter
        > python setup.py install

    Note: Do not include the '>' character when copying the command

    After running these three lines you should be all good to try the example
    runs below!
